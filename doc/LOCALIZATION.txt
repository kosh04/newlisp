LOCALIZATION
============

See chapter 'Customization Localization and UTF-8' in the 
Users Manual and the usage of 'set-locale' function in the 
Function Reference.

The 'set-locale' function will not influence the behaviour of
PCRE (Perl Compatible Regular Expressions) in newLISP, but a
special option flag number can be set to support UTF-8 in all
functions supporting regular expressions like: regex, find,
replace, parse and search.

To further localize the behaviour of regular expressions in newLISP
the file 'pcre-chartables.c' must be replaced with a localized
version. To obtain this file for your locale, follow these steps:

(1) get the pcre source distribution from http://www.pcre.org

(2) follow the instruction in it's README file to 'configure'
    and  'make' it. An installation is not necessary. Just using
    the 'configure' and 'make' steps will create a file called
    'chartables.c' suitable for the locale on your computer
    system. Rename this file to 'pcre-chartables.c', which it
    replaces in the newLISP source distribution.

(3) recompile newLISP

newLISP will now show regular expression behaviour in functions
like 'regex', 'find', 'replace' and 'parse' appropiate to your
locale. The function 'set-locale' should still be used to change
all other aspects of newLISP to your locale.

newLISP can be used with multi-byte character languages when
compiled with UTF-8 options. For some OS flavors UTF-8 enabled
makefile are shipped in the source distribution.

When compiled with UTF-8 character handling some newLISP functions
will work on multibyte characters instead of single bytes. See
the manual for details.
