(1) WIN32 BINARY DISTRIBUTION INSTALLATION
------------------------------------------

The Win32 binary distribution comes packed asa Win32 installer
application. After downloading a file:

    newlisp-xxxx-win-gs-xxx.exe

douuble click on it and follow instructtions. xxxx and xxx are
the version numbers for newLISP and the newLISP-tk the GUI frontend.


(2) BUILD newLISP FROM SOURCE for LINUX, free/net/openBSD, MacOSX, Solaris
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Un-tar/gunzip the distribution file newlisp_9.x.x.tgz :

    tar xzvf newlisp_9.x.x.tgz

Change the current directory in to newlisp_x.x.x/
From the command line do:

    make

this will automatically detect one of the platforms Linus, MacOS X, FreeBSD,
OpenBSD, NetBSD and SunOS/Solaris.

To just check what OS flavor make would detect, type:

    ./configure

ther are many other flavors for different OS and compilers type
make with help to see all options: 

    make help

If 'make' comes back with error messages try gmake, or any other 
make compatible with gmake.

to remove objects and before switching make flavors:

    make clean

Since version 9.0.14 newLISP can also be compiled for 64-bit Linux
with 64-bit memory pointers. See the file: Makefile for details.


(3) COMMENTS FOR COMPILING AND LINKING
--------------------------------------

Some OS's and installations may not support 'readline' or support for
milli seconds resolution in the time functions or library import functionality.
See the options NANOSLEEP, READLINE and NOIMPORT in the makefile_xxx
for your platform and compilation flavor. When using the READLINE option
on some OSs the library options -lreadline and -lncurses or -ltermcap have
to be replaced. Study the makefile of your platorm.

On MacOSX the flavor 'osx' is without readline support the flavor 'darwin'
is with readline support.

On some platforms the warning message "ANSI does not support long long" will be
issued for every file compiled. This message can be discarded and does not occur
on newer versions of GCC. The 'long long' data type is not used anywhere in the 
newLISP source but part of some header files of the GCC installation.

The Linux version is without readline support by default, because readline
support does not come in the default install of many Linux distributions.

When creating Win32 versions read the file README_WIN32 first.


(4) TOOLS
---------

Besides gcc for the 'C' compiler, several other tools are used for packaging
the installer for Win32, configuring PCRE etc. These tools can be found at: 
http://newlisp.org/download/Tools/

For a normal installation from the source distribution only the GCC or
compatible compiler is required.


(5) LOCALIZATION
----------------

The PCRE Regular Expressions code can be localized to your country/language 
(see comments in file 'makefile'), it comes with default character tables for
English. For correct working of other string functions in your country/language
a localizable 'C' library/OS may have to be used. The names of newLISP functions can
be localized during runtime without performance loss, (see newlisp_manual.html).

There are also UTF-8 versions/makefiles available in the source distribution.
See the chapter about 'Customization, localization and UTF-8' in the manual.


(6) INSTALLING AFTER BUILDING FROM SOURCE
-----------------------------------------

To install log in as super user or root and do:

    make install

On Mac OSX when not running as superuser (but with admin rights):

    sudo make install

If you cannot get super user or root privileges, newslisp can be installed
in yur home directory in $HOME/bin and $HOME/share instead of /usr/bin
and /usr/share

    make install_home

This will create /usr/share/newlisp  or $HOME/bin and $HOME/share/newlisp and
/usr/share/doc/newlisp or $HOME/share/doc/newlisp

(7) UNINSTALL
--------------

sto uninstall if installed with make install do:

    make uninstall

or if installed with install_home

    make uninstall_home

    
make and executables are tested on Mandrake Linux, FreeBSD, Solaris
Darwin/Mac OSX and WinXP Home

(8) RUNNING newLISP IN A SHELL OR CONSOLE WINDOW
-------------------------------------------------

On all platforms simply execute:
 
 newlisp <enter>

on the command line. On Win32 the execution path of newlisp.exe was added
to the environment during installation. On all other platforms the newlisp
binary is in /usr/bin/newlisp or when using the home install in $HOME/bin
where $HOME is the the home directory of the user taken from the environment
variable HOME.


(9) RUNNING THE newLISP-GS GRAPHICAL FRONTEND

On Win32 and Mac OS X a Java based syntaxhighlighting editor is installed in
in the Applications menus. The editor needs a Java runtime environment JRE
versin 1.5 as a minimum. In case it is not installed it can be obtained from
http://java.sun.com .
